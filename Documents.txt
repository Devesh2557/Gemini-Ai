Install virtual Enviornment

pip Install virtualenv

Now we will create our virtual Enviornment

python -m venv myenv

Now, we will activate our virtual Enviornment

myenv\scripts\activate

what is our goal

Application------> works as a chatgpt 
we have to create a function who will take our query as input and send it to llm(google-generative-ai) and then create response and return the response in textual format.

So, first all of we have to create a requirements.txt in which file we have all the packages or libraries that er need to run our application.
In 'requirements.txt'
streamlit----------->(it is for ui)
google-generativeai----------->(this is our llm model which is use to convert model in textual format)
python-dotenv----------->(this is use for pass or import our secret credentials from.env file to another file.)

Now we will create a file(.env)-----------> Have all the secrets here.


api key=>  Application programming interface who works client to server as a mediator.

go to browser---> Search(makersuit api key)-------> click google studio------->

click on create api key -----> paste it into .env file.

Now will create app.py in which we will have our all logics to create this application.

for run the application , open the terminal and write 

streamlit run app.py
